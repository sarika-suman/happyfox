📌 Employee Organization Chart – Interactive Hierarchy Viewer
The Employee Organization Chart is a dynamic, interactive web application that visualizes company structure in a tree-like format. It allows users to search, filter, and reorganize employee-manager relationships through drag-and-drop functionality.

This project was created as part of an assignment to demonstrate frontend development skills using modern frameworks and tools.

🌟 My Contributions

🔹 Frontend Development (React)
Built a responsive tree-structured chart to represent employee-manager hierarchy visually.
Implemented search and filtering functionality to locate employees quickly by name or department.
Developed drag-and-drop support to change reporting structure by reassigning managers in real time.
Used React Context API / Redux (if used) to manage and propagate state across the component tree.
Connected with a mock API using MirageJS or PretenderJS to simulate backend operations like fetch and update.
Applied Bootstrap / Custom CSS to design a clean, professional UI with intuitive UX.
